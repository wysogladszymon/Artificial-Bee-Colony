# Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm
## What is it
This project is part of our ```Operations Research``` course, where we explore various heuristic algorithms. I chose to optimize the Parcel Delivery Problem using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, which was assigned to me. This project allowed me to delve into ABC while addressing a practical optimization challenge.

## What I have learned
- Gained a solid understanding of the ```ABC``` algorithm and successfully implemented it in both ```Python``` and ```TypeScript```.
- Enhanced my skills in ```React``` and ```TypeScript```, particularly through the use of libraries such as ```MobX```, ```Recharts```, and ```Bootstrap```.
